### Tutorial Used 
youtube - The Net Ninja - Complete React Tutorial(&Redux)<br />
`url(https://youtu.be/OxIDLw0M-m0)`<br />
What I kept same: much of the react js code is the same <br />
What is different: Much more content and components added. <br />
The Idea to turn a todo app into a kids game was mine <br />
Added multiple projects together, not just the todo app (Complete React Tutorial pt.#23,24) <br />
The game info toggle is mine <br />
All css is mine <br />


### What I Would Like to Add
Redux to make content stay on reload <br />
Make Custom Missions more dynameic, saveable <br />
add a name converter, to make custom ninja sounding names <br />
